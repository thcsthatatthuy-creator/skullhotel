#### Map Visualization

The game features six distinct enemy types:

- 🟩 **Raid**: If you hear knocking or see a sign, you must hide and wait for the monster to leave.
- 🟨 **Claymore**: The monster is behind a door or curtain, and you must quickly close it before it attacks.
- 🟪 **Hideout**: It hides and surprises you while you're completing objectives.
- 🟥 **Landmine**: It hides and jumps at you if you move too close.
- 🟦 **Sonar**: Located in the bathroom - you must listen at the door and avoid opening it if you hear breathing.
- 🟧 **Hunter**: It emerges from a hiding spot and chases you - your only option is to run.

The console displays your current game seed with each enemy type represented by a unique color:
